                <hr>
            <p class="text"> Hello there! My name is Adam Howell, I have a Cavoodle dog named Casper , I am currently studying Information Technology at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology through Open University Australia. A little history about me, I'm a certified mechanic and had worked in the field for close to nine years. I decided to step away from that role and enter an industry of something I've also been passionate about, the world of I.T! 
                I grew up playing video games from a very young age, my father brought home a PlayStation One with his first paycheck from his new job when I was around 5 years old. I grew up playing a variety of games like: Medal of Honor, Gran Turismo, Crash Bandicoot and many other games as I became older. Which then became an original Xbox console, then a Nintendo Wii and then an Xbox 360. The Xbox 360 was when I experienced the world of Online Play, connecting to matchmaking lobbies on Call of Duty with my friends after school. 
                I then built my first computer around 2011 when I decided to select Multimedia as an elective in school. I have since built two computers since then with massive leaps in performance between each build. 
                Information Technology has been an interest since my early childhood, and I am looking forward to developing skills by studying through RMIT University to advance my passion into a career in the Cyber Security industry!

            <h1 class="headings">INTEREST IN IT</h1>
            <h2>HOW IT ALL BEGAN</h2>
            <h3 class="points"> WHAT IS YOUR INTEREST IN IT? WHEN DID YOUR INTEREST IN IT START? WAS THERE A PARTICULAR EVEN OR PERSON THAT SPARKED YOUR INTEREST? OUTLINE EXPERIENCE (IF ANY) </h3>
            <p class="text"> I have an immense interest in the continually developing world of technology. From NASA spacecraft using computing and guidance systems to land and return from the Moon in 1969, to our handheld smartphone devices that can calculate equations 120,000,000 times faster than the Apollo onboard computer (Puiu, 2022). It's improvements like these that prove the exponential growth IT has and thus began my interest in wanting to pursue a career. 
                My interest in IT was guided by the growing availability for consumers over time. At a young age, my first real interaction with IT was with a PlayStation One console. With this came the astonishing realization that ideas could be brought to life by ways of the video gaming world. These moments with gaming solidified my passion for IT. As well as gaming consoles, my passion grew for IT when I was introduced to Personal Computers (PC), which shortly introduced me to the world of the Internet.
                Unfortunately, my IT experience is limited to what I have learned at home as well as online video websites and articles. I have a basic understanding of Networking, both Local Area Networking (LAN) and Wi-Fi networking. But my passion and willingness to learn about IT will come forward in my learning and future career. Further, for close to Ten years, I was a mechanic in my family's business. This experience allowed me to access computing information installed in modern-day motor vehicles, and the computing systems we used to process our goods and services day-to-day.
                
                 </p>
            <h4 class="points"> WHY DID YOU CHOSE TO COME TO RMIT? </h4>
            <p class="text">RMIT gave me the ability to study a subject I share so much passion. It gave me the flexibility of online learning so I could study at my desired university inter-state. The main fact that stood out to me was that RMIT achieved a 1st place rating in the QS Employability Rankings in 2022 (Reputation and rankings, 2022). Compared to the other Open University offerings of IT, due to the high employability rankings, the well-implemented online learning capabilities and the ease of applying and enrolling. </p>

            <h5 class="points"> WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO LEARN DURING YOUR STUDIES? </h5>
            <p class="text"> I expect to learn about the contemporary world of IT and its concepts. I want to be prepared for professional life, for example, writing IT reports and presenting my work to colleagues. I would like to learn collaborative working so that I can resolve potential conflicts and be productive with my teams. This course, for example, will see me learning ICT components to help me create my prototype. This objective intrigues me and my passion for IT, and I look forward to seeing how these new skills relate to my future learning and career. </p>

                <h2> CYBER SECURITY </h2>
                <h3 class="points"> A DESCRIPTION (IN YOUR OWN WORDS) OF THE POSITION, AND PARTICULARLY WHAT MAKES THIS POSITION APPEARLING TO YOU? </h3>
                <p class="text"> The position that is being offered is an IT Security Operations Analyst, that works as a team member to monitor and combat threats to an organisation's IT infrastructure. They also evaluate security systems and procedures for flaws and potential enhancements, as well as provide technical support for security systems. 
                    For this role, some responsibilities include, but are not limited to security audits, liaising with stakeholders and other IT personnel, being in-charge of networks and servers, complying with policies and delegations that are applicable, and meeting targets & resolve problems promptly.
                    This position intrigues me due to the high demand in this field of security work and can be argued to be the most important role in contemporary IT. I believe this is due to the exponentially growing IT sector, which comes with its growing security risks. This section of IT I believe is imperative for not just large, but small businesses as IT grows and the demand for security will become higher. </p>
                <h4 class="points"> A DESCRIPTION (IN YOUR OWN WORDS) OF THE SKILLS, QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE REQUIRED FOR THE POSITION </h4>
                <p class="text">There is quite a significant amount of skill and experience required for this role. It is expected you have three to five years of IT Security Operational Support or another related area, as well as experience in Investment Management, Forcepoint and DLP systems. Knowledge is required in IT security, Microsoft servers and operating systems, data loss protection and whitelisting, risk management and cyber-security identification and detection. I recognise a substantial amount of prior experience and expertise will be needed of me to apply for such a role.  </p>
                
                <h5 class="points"> A DESCRIPTION (IN YOUR OWN WORDS) OF THE SKILLS, QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE YOU CURRENTLY HAVE </h5>
                <p class="text"> I have a basic understanding of Microsoft/Windows operating systems, which involves enabling firewalls and installing anti-virus software. I also have experience in installing new components into computer systems, that is, building my own PC systems. With devotion to my studies and future traineeships, I hope to expand my skillset in IT.  </p>
                
                <h6 class="points"> A PLAN DESCRIBING HOW YOU WILL OBTAIN THE SKILLS, QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE REQUIRED FOR THE POSITION, BUILDING ON THOSE YOU HAVE NOW </h6>
                <p class="text"> To gain the experience and skills required for this role, I have outlined a few specific goals. My first goal is obtaining my Bachelor of Information Technology, and Majoring in Cyber-Security, with the potential to gain my Masters. Good solid results in my subjects, will also help me stand out and gain more opportunities of growth. 
                    My next goal would be to gain experience through a traineeship or internship that will give me the experience required for this kind of role. For example, I could do an internship at a school or small business helping run their security infrastructure. I'd hope to do a role like this while studying at university and for networking opportunities as well. 
                    My final goal is hopefully to acquire a graduate role before applying for a job like this. This will provide myself the best opportunity to working in a real-life collaborative team environment. These collective goals will help ensure I stay on a path that gives me the best opportunity to get this role. </p>

                <h2>LEARNING STYLES, MYERS-BRIGGS PERSONALITY & BIG FIVE FACTORS</h2>
                <div class="pptext">
                <h3 class="points"> WHAT DO THE RESULTS OF THESE TESTS MEAN FOR YOU?</h3>
                <p class="text"> These tests give an insight as to what my personality may bring to the team, and it shows I'm mainly an extroverted person. For example, being extraverted in a workplace setting will allow me to collaborate with my peers with personal engagement.
                    Another aspect I noted was that I can agree with my peers on many different ideas and/or views of subjects and can deal with situations in a sensible and realistic manner for my peers. This in relation to my Big 5 personality being 91% agreeable.
                    Regarding my learning style, I am quite even across the board, this means I have a broad range of skills in how I learn which is beneficial to quick thinking and problem-solving techniques.
                    Therefore, these traits show I can be a team player & team leader, and that I have confidence in my team building skills and efficiency. </p>
                
                <h4 class="points"> HOW DO YOU THINK THESE RESULTS MAY INFLUENCE YOUR BEHAVIOUR IN A TEAM? </h4>

                <p class="text">As a Consul (ESFJ-T) based on the Myers-Briggs test, I am 70% observant and 73% feeling. These results show I am a caring and encouraging team member who collaborates without judgement and works to bring out the best in my peers. 
                    My agreeableness and conscientiousness factors are high and thus reflect how I would be an asset to a collaborative team. My agreeableness shows how I respect everyone's opinion and understand the importance of their contributions. On the flip side, my conscientiousness is a testament to my work ethic and how I will always strive for my best work individually or in a team setting.
                    Lastly, my main learning style is Pragmatist. This means I listen and try out all ideas and opinions others bring to me. I believe that every idea should have its chance to be applied in a real work setting to show its capability. 
                    These examples show how my behaviour, proven by my learning styles, Big 5 and personality tests, would be useful and efficient in a team setting. </p>
                
                <h5 class="points">HOW SHOULD YOU TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT WHEN FORMING A TEAM? </h5>
                <p class="text"> I believe every team will succeed if it has different people with different strengths and backgrounds. This helps each other learn and grow their skill sets as they problem-solve and cooperate. 
                    However, everyone has their weak spots, to which I am not immune. I recognise that my imagination factor is only 46% on my Big 5 test results and in correlation with this, I am only 30% intuitive. This means I need to work on these skills and group projects I believe are a great way to improve them.
                    Based on the tests, I believe I am a good mediator and one who encourages the best of each of us on the team. My work ethic is also strong, which will ensure we meet deadlines that we set ourselves. These factors will help reduce stress and encourage our time to be focused on learning and growing. </p>

            <h2>NEXT WEATHER - THE CLIMATE RADAR (Application) </h2>
            
            <h3>MOTIVATION</h3>
            <p>Our world is looking different every decade, year, day and month now. The effects of climate change have seen homes swept away by floods, fires decimating crops, and nuclear fallout that destroys entire populations. Our access to information and help is needed more than ever. Clear and concise accessibility on survival is imperative soon. Like how to access those evacuation centres in a flood, where the fires are in our local areas and how to ensure we can protect ourselves from exposure. But why is our information, our forecasts, news, indexes and updates on these events, all in different places? 
                These precious moments we may have to survive, mean we need one access point for information. Thus, the need for “Next Weather – The Climate Radar”. The monthly in-depth briefing on your local climate data is collated by local authorities, the community and government bodies. These will include the air index, emergency weather alerts including natural disasters, evacuation centres, and short guides on surviving natural and man-made disasters. </p>

            <h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
            <p>With information scattered all over the Internet, we can struggle to find the correct website for the correct information promptly, with society shifting towards ease of access, this application aims to assist in this area. 
                Let's look at one of the main ideas for this application, we're aiming to have industries that rely heavily on the weather, like farmers, use the information that we can easily provide them (Hughes & Gooday, 2022). As the 2020 State of The Climate report reiterates: “Australian rainfall is highly variable and is strongly influenced by drivers such as El Niño, La Niña, the Indian Ocean Dipole and the Southern Annular Mode. Despite this natural variability, long term trends are evident in Australia's rainfall record” (Climate change in Australia 2020). Therefore, providing accessible information on these variable weather events is imperative. These kinds of reports are vital for the Farming Industry, and we aim to bring them to the consumer with the most precise and clear information possible. Therefore, this application is greatly important for the well-being and security of our communities.
                So, what makes the application so important for the consumer? Let's look at what features we plan on bringing in. Firstly, flooding is a natural disaster but can also be classified as a man-made disaster because of Climate Change. Flooding can occur by weather events, such as heavy rainfall or storms. It can also happen by what is known as a “King Tide” (BOM), which is where the Moon's gravitational pull affects the oceans on the globe. Bush fires are another example, and they can be caused by natural ignition. For example, lightning strikes, or human error (accidental or on purpose). They can be aggravated by other weather events such as wind gusts, droughts, high temperatures and low humidity. A guide on these weather events enables the consumer to understand how much of a risk there may or may not be daily and contain information about what they can do if this occurs. 
                Another example is air quality which is essential for the world to live and thrive. The air index allows for the population to determine if the quality of air that is present at their location is ideal to breathe. It will also track major airborne pollutants such as Ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide (NSW Government, Air Quality Basics).
                Another aspect of the application is thunderstorms. These are natural and common events present in the world today, of which, early information can become available due to the data that can be gathered days in advance of the weather event with today's technology. Ease of access to this information allows the consumer to predict and plan based on the weather advice. Thunderstorms can be deadly for humans, particularly with Asthmatic conditions. Melbourne experienced what was known as an “Epidemic Thunderstorm Asthma” on November the 21st 2016, which resulted in the deaths of 10 people and thousands struggling to breathe (Wood, 2017). Early detection and awareness are vital for those suffering from asthma to avoid doing activities that could potentially put them in an area where 'grass pollen' may be high (Wood, 2017).
                With major weather events like flooding and bushfires occurring in Australia on a regular occurrence every year, most victims that are in the affected areas will be required to evacuate and seek refuge at an evacuation centre. Locating your local evacuation centre can be tricky, with relying on outsourcing the information via social media or government websites. The app plans to introduce this information reliably to the consumer, for a hassle-free experience. 
                Further still, you may require tips and guides for survival in events such as Nuclear Explosions. A nuclear blast can cause a lot of damage to humans, for example, the bright flash can cause severe eyesight damage or loss, the shockwave can cause internal organ failure, and the heat from the explosion can burn your skin (CDC radiation emergencies 2018). Even still, nuclear fallout will give you severe (if not fatal) radiation poisoning (CDC radiation emergencies 2018). There are many tips and ways learnt over the years to give you the best chance at survival possible. Having locally saved government issues websites available for viewing on the app available, means the consumer has the best chance of preventing injury or death. </p>

            <h5>TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY</h5>
            <p>Using the BOM website for weather information, RFS & SES for advice and the community for updated information for their local evacuation centre/s. Servers will be required to store and archive information for weather events and what may be common in a particular postcode. Due to the outsourcing of information, the application requires less equipment use such as weather stations. Artificial Intelligence can be used for automated information gathering. </p>

            <h6>SKILLS REQUIRED & OUTCOME</h6>
            <p> Due to the outsourcing of information for the weather application, the skills depend upon those we source from. For example, meteorologists will be required for advice and distribution of information for the application. The RFS, SES, local community and meteorology websites are outsourced skills that will be used within the application. However, there will need to be a team to run the application, deal with customer complaints and feedback, and perform software updates as required. Therefore, software application developers, customer service members and the intermediary will be required between stakeholders. <br> In conclusion, this application is designed to create information in the most accessible manner for the consumer. The issue we currently face is climate change and present the information we need to survive is too complex and difficult to decipher in an emergency. This application will help solve this by using clear, concise messages and push alerts for people who need this information quickly. This application will have future positive ramifications that can potentially save lives, and better the chance of people staying healthy throughout their lifetime. </p>
